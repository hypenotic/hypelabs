        <h1>Customer Experience</h1>

<h1>Guiding Principles</h1>

<h2>Long term relationships</h2>

<p>We know doing more with people who already appreciate us is better for our business long term. Beyond being easier to serve, old clients can be the ultimate source of better qualified leads. The people they send our way will be coming via someone they trust, and should be therefore easier to start a relationship with. They will also
will be coming for the right reasons, increasing the chances they’re a good fit for us to work with. 
Naturally, we invest a lot of time making our clients happy, going above and beyond project expectations. When conflicts arise, we work it out. We&#39;re in it for the long haul.</p>

<h2>A partnership approach</h2>

<p>We consider our clients co-creators, and include them in every stage of the process. As we learn about their challenges, they learn about marketing, design and development practices.</p>

<h2>Transparency</h2>

<p>Transparency means having real conversations, and answering real questions. No agendas, spun yarns, marketing jargon, or shell games. Its more than providing information, its about providing the information clients asked for and letting them make up their own minds. </p>

<h2>An open mind</h2>

<p>Sometimes client relationships can be stressful. The wants and needs of clients can put a lot of pressure on us communications folks who are doing our best to deliver on time, on budget, etc. Like a marriage, these relationships can fall under the spell of predictable patterns where you think you know what the person’s going to say even before they’ve said it. This is not a good for any relationship. Approaching every interaction with an open mind helps to hear what is being said, and keeps us from reacting to the “old tapes” in our head.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

<p>Every touch point must be consistent and logical in order to build trust with the client. </p>

<h2>Surprise &amp; delight</h2>

<p>We interact with people many more times a day than we realize. Think beyond every time we answer the phone or have a meeting to things like 404 pages, auto confirmations, sign-ups and friend requests. These third party experiences are opportunities to build a relationships by going a step beyond the default reaction.  </p>

<h2>Thinking bigger</h2>

<p>It&#39;s not enough to know what we know- we&#39;re in the business of helping people. This means asking ourselves questions like:
* What do we know about our customers that could help them when they most need it?
* What could we do to ease a problem our customers are having– even if it has nothing to do with the quality of our product?</p>
